## Assignments

- Mar. 19th: Assignment 1 is announced. See here: https://github.com/aqjune/swpp202001-assn1

If you cannot compile word.cpp, please check whether your `g++` supports c++17. `g++ -version` should print version 7 or upper.

- Mar. 27th: Assignment 2 is announced. Deadline is Apr. 1st, midnight.
See here: https://github.com/snu-sf-class/swpp202001/tree/master/practice/2.assn

NOTE: The goal of assignment 2 is to write a simple function using IR by your own.
Please don't simply create .ll file using `clang -emit-llvm ..` and submit it.
Such .ll file has idioms/variable namings that are generated by compiler optimizations, such as a zero-extended induction variable (variable `i` in `for (i=0; ..)`).
